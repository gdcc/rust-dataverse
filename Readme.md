# Dataverse Rust

![Build Status](https://github.com/JR-1991/rust-dataverse/actions/workflows/tests.yml/badge.svg)

**Dataverse Rust** is a client library and command-line interface (CLI) for interacting with
the [Dataverse API](https://guides.dataverse.org/en/latest/api/). This project is in active development and not yet
feature complete.

## Features

Current capabilities include:

### Collection Management

- **Create**: Create a new collection within the Dataverse.
- **Delete**: Remove an existing collection.
- **Publish**: Publish a collection to make it publicly available.
- **Contents**: Retrieve the contents of a collection.

### General Information

- **Version**: Retrieve the current version of the Dataverse instance.

### Dataset Management

- **Get**: Fetch details of a specific dataset.
- **Create**: Create a new dataset within a collection.
- **Edit**: Modify an existing dataset.
- **Delete**: Delete an unpublished dataset.
- **Upload**: Upload a file to a dataset.
- **Direct S3 upload**: Upload a file directly to an S3 bucket.
- **Publish**: Publish a dataset to make it publicly available.
- **Link**: Link datasets to other collections.

### File Management

- **Replace**: Replace existing files in a dataset.

## Installation

**Command line**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JR-1991/rust-dataverse.git
cd rust-dataverse
cargo install --path .
```

**Cargo.toml**

Please note, this crate is not yet published on crates.io. You can add it to your `Cargo.toml` file by pointing to the
GitHub repository.

```toml
[dependencies]
dataverse = { git = "https://github.com/JR-1991/rust-dataverse" }
```

## Usage

### Command line

Before you can use the command line tool, you need to set the `DVCLI_URL` and `DVCLI_TOKEN` environment variables. You
can do this by adding the following lines to your `.bashrc` or `.bash_profile` file:

```bash
export DVCLI_URL="https://your.dataverse.url"
export DVCLI_TOKEN="your_token_here"
```

The command line tool in organized in subcommands. To see a list of available subcommands, run:

```bash
dvcli --help
```

To see help for a specific subcommand, run:

```bash
dvcli <subcommand> --help
```

**Example**

In this examples we will demonstrate how to retrieve the version of the Dataverse instance.

```bash
dvcli info version
```

The output will be similar to:

```bash
Calling: http://localhost:8080/api/info/version
â””â”€â”€  ðŸŽ‰ Success! - Received the following response:

{
  "version": "6.2"
}
```

## Examples

We have provided an example in the `examples` directory. These examples demonstrate how to use the client to perform
various operations.

* [`examples/create-upload-publish`](examples/create-upload-publish) - Demonstrates how to create a collection, dataset,
  upload a file, and publish the collection and dataset.

## ToDo's

- [ ] Implement remaining API endpoints
- [x] Write unit and integration tests
- [x] Asynchronous support using `tokio`
- [x] Documentation
- [ ] Publish on crates.io
- [x] Continuous integration
- [ ] Validate before upload using `/api/dataverses/$ID/validateDatasetJson`

/// Deletes a collection identified by its alias.
///
/// This asynchronous function sends a DELETE request to the API to remove a specific collection
/// within a dataverse, identified by the collection's alias.
///
/// # Arguments
///
/// * `client` - A reference to the `BaseClient` instance used to send the request.
/// * `alias` - A string slice that holds the alias of the collection to be deleted.
///
/// # Returns
///
/// A `Result` wrapping a `Response<CollectionDeleteResponse>` on success, or a `String` error message on failure.
/// The `Response` object contains the HTTP response status and the deserialized response data indicating the outcome of the deletion.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```no_run
/// use dataverse::prelude::*;
///
/// # async fn run_example() -> Result<(), String> {
/// let api_token = "api_token".to_string();
/// let base_url = "https://demo.dataverse.com".to_string();
/// let client = BaseClient::new(&base_url, Some(&api_token))
///     .expect("Failed to create client");
///
/// let alias = "my_collection";
/// let result = collection::delete_collection(&client, alias).await?;
/// 
/// println!("Deletion result: {:?}", result);
/// # Ok(())
/// # }

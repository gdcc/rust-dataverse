/// Deletes a dataset by its ID.
///
/// This asynchronous function sends a DELETE request to the API to remove a dataset identified by its ID.
///
/// # Arguments
///
/// * `client` - A reference to the `BaseClient` instance used to send the request.
/// * `id` - A reference to the ID of the dataset to be deleted.
///
/// # Returns
///
/// A `Result` wrapping a `Response<UnpublishedDatasetDeleteResponse>` on success, or a `String` error message on failure.
/// The `Response` object contains the HTTP response status and the deserialized response data indicating the outcome of the delete action.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// Basic usage:
///
/// ```no_run
/// # use dataverse::prelude::*;
/// # async fn run() -> Result<(), String> {
/// let api_token = "api_token".to_string();
/// let base_url = "https://demo.dataverse.com".to_string();
/// let client = BaseClient::new(&base_url, Some(&api_token))
///     .expect("Failed to create client");
///
/// let dataset_id: i64 = 123;
///
/// let response = dataset::delete_dataset(&client, &dataset_id).await?;
///
/// println!("Dataset deletion response: {:?}", response);
/// # Ok(())
/// # }
/// ```

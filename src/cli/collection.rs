//! Collection-related CLI commands for managing Dataverse collections
//!
//! This module provides commands for collection management tasks like:
//! - Creating new collections within parent dataverses
//! - Retrieving collection content and metadata
//! - Publishing collections to make them public
//! - Deleting collections from the instance
